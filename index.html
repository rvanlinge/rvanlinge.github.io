								<b>Current Project</b><br>
								<u>Summary</u><br>
								I am currently working on one of the first continuous, long-term radio montoring of two ultra-cool, low-mass binaries - 2MASS 1314+1320 (M7+M7) and 2MASS 1315-2649 (L5+T7).By using the Karl Janksy Very Large Array (VLA) I use very long baseline intefereometry to observe these two dwatf binaries. Most radio observations have been investigating magnetic activity/cycles on the timescale of a few rotations and atempts to observe long-term activity have been poorly sampled. It is known that our Sun has a solar cycle of 11 years therefore a continuous observation of these ultra-cool, low-mass objects is important in characterizing their magnetic behaviors to understand the dynamo that generates these magnetic fields.<br>
								
								<u>Background</u><br>
								Partially convective stars, such as our Sun, are known to generate magnetic fields through a process called "alpha-omega dynamo". This dynamo relies on the shearing between the radiative core and the convective envelope at the transitional zone known as the tachocline. These magnetic fields produce h-alpha (optical), X-Ray, and radio emissions. The first two are indirect measuremments of the magnetic fields that originate from reconnection events that heat up the different layers of the star's atmosphere. Radio emission is the most direct signature that arises from charged particles accelerating around the magnetic fields themselves. Stars, naturally, show a decline in h-alpha and X-Ray emission as their masses and surface temperatures decreases. When their masses are less than 0.35 solar masses, they become fully convective and lack a tachocline and believed to not be able to generate magnetic fields. Yet, we see in roughly 10% of the low-mass objects have steady, or even an increase, in radio activity. These objects behaviors range vastly from stead persistent emission to periodic polarized bursts. Because these fully convective stars lack a tachocline, it begs the question as to what kind of dynamo is generating their magnetic fields. Understanding these low-mass stars magnetic fields is vital as these objects are often the main targets for exoplanets and star-planet interaction is important in deciding whether a planet is habitiable or not.
