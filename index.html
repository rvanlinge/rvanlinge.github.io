								<b>Current Project</b><br>I am currently working on the first continuous, long-term radio montoring of two ultra-cool, low-mass binaries - 2MASS 1314+1320 (M7+M7) and 2MASS 1315-2649 (L5+T7). Most observations on radio emitting  have been investigating magnetic activity/cycles on the timescale of a few rotations and atempts to observe long-term activity have been poorly sampled. Because we know our Sun shows magnetic cycles every eleven years, it is important to see if these fully convective stars also show this behavior as it will allow us to understand the origin of these magnetic fields. Stars that are partially convective are believed to produce magnetic fields through the &alpha -&omega dynamo which relies on the shearing between the radiative core and the convective envelope at the transitional zone known as the <i>tachocline</i>. Low-mass stars (less than 0.3 solar masses) are fully and lack a tachocline and therefore were believed to not be able to produce large-scale magentic fields. Yet we see
